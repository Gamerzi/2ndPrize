Dear i,

You're the letter that starts it all,
The first in the alphabet, standing tall.
You're the one that leads the way,
The beginning of every day.

In math, you're the imaginary one,
A force that's never done.
You're the square root of -1,
A concept so fun.

In science, you're the isotope,
The one that's always in scope.
You're the symbol for current,
A flow that's always urgent.

In language, you're the prefix "in",
A word that often begins.
You're the prefix for inside,
A place where secrets hide.

You're the first vowel in many a name,
A sound that's soft and the same.
You're the one that starts a word,
A letter that's often heard.

Dear i, you're the letter we adore,
The one that's never a bore.
You're the letter that starts it all,
A true winner, standing tall.

Sincerely,
Baqer
